## How to Run the Code
- Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/moazamdev/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
- Navigate to the directory using cd data-structures-and-algorithms
- To run a specific program, navigate to the respective folder and run the command g++ -o <program_name> <program_name>.cpp && ./<program_name>
- Alternatively, to run all programs, run the command make in the root directory. This will compile all the programs and create executables which can be run using the command ./<program_name>
